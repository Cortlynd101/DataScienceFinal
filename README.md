# DataScienceFinal
This repository is for the purpose of turning in my final for Data Science.

For this project I used a dataset from Kaggle named “NBA Players.” The description of the dataset is: “Biometric, biographic and basic box score stats from 1996 to 2022 season.” 
The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data?resource=download
The dataset needs to be loaded into the ‘sample_data’ folder for Google Collab to work (which is what I did this on). 
The dataset file is the one in the repository named "all_seasons.csv"
The file I used on Google Colab is the one in the repository named "Final_Project_Data_Science_Spring_2024.ipynb"

The presentation part of this assignment is available in the paper that is part of this repository. It is the pdf titled: "Final Project Presentation Data Science - Spring 2024.pdf"
If you want to see in closer detail any of the picures that I used on the report they are all available in the "Data Science Final Pictures" folder.
